# Mlflow

This project demonstrates various steps in the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, model tracking, serialization, creating REST APIs, containerization, and consumption.

## Project Overview

- Start by preprocessing your data.
- Train 5 ML models.
  - Try to track model performance, versions, and parameters using MLflow. 
  
  run `mlflow ui`

in our case it is very that the 3rd model(Logistic Regression) perform better with an accuracy of 0.90, therefore we will use for the rest of this lab
- Save your best model in ONNX format and its dedicated preprocessing transformations in pickle format (i.e., using transformers API).

## Usage

### Using FastAPI

- Create a REST API for your model.
- Using the serialized files.
- Package your model as a container using Docker.
- Consume your created APIs using Curl.

### Using Flask

- Create a dedicated application to consume your API.

- Package your application as a container using Docker.

## How to Run

` 
  - git clone https://github.com/hassanoubrahim/Text-Classification-with-MLflow-and-FastAPI.git
  - cd Text-Classification-with-MLflow-and-FastAPI
  - pip install requirments.txt
  `
you can run FastApi application using 
  - python3 fast-api.py
or you can choose Flask application using
  - python3 flask-app.py
